# React Firebase Whatsapp Clone with Next.js and Firebase-hooks

[Live demo](https://whatsapp-clone-one-bay.vercel.app/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This porject might contain dummy firebase credentials.

## Getting Started

First, set up .env.local and add following env variables (dummy):

    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=xxxx
    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxx
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=xxxx
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET=xxxx
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxxx
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=xxxx

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
